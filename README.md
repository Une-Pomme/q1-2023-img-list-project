# Image List Project 
This is the project built for the "Section 7: User Inputs, Forms, and Events in ReactJS" and "Section 8: API Request with React" sections of Oak Academy's "Typescript & React JS Course with React & Typescript Project" Udemy course.

## What I got out of this project

Most of these lessons were things that I already knew. But I did learn:
- That in React Community conventions for functional components, you put config objects & helper functions are the top of the file and the component at the bottom
- The reason it's preferred to arrow functions in class components is because it automatically binds the function to the component instance (which prevents issues with `this`)
    - (I think this was something I learned when I first started with React, but over time, I forgot the reason I was using arrow functions for the component methods)
- How to use async/await with API calls instead of relying on callbacks
